- A way to make changes easily
- Hosted on my own domain rather than github pages
- Use a CMS that makes implementation a easy
- Fast track the look and feel

## This porfolio uses:
- [React Bricks](https://reactbricks.com) specifically [the starter kit.](https://github.com/reactbricks/nextjs-starter-reactbricks-tailwind)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
